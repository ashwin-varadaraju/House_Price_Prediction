# House_Price_Prediction

## Problem Statement:

Predicting house prices can help to determine the buying/selling price of a house which help clients to find the right time to buy a home based on certain factors like area of a house, year the house was built, whether it's furnished or not, etc. As a result, regression techniques have been used to predict the efficient house pricing for customers with respect to their priority and budget.
